## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the source materials, drafts, and visual assets for **Artifact #3**, a Multimodal Research Project. This instructive website is designed to showcase my research for Dr. Sturm's
ENGL 1102 final project where I conducted heavy research on Lee Krasner, the Abstract Expressionist movement,
and her piece "The Seasons." I decided to ditch the website builders and create my own SPA from the ground-up.
